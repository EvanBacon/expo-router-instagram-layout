# Expo Router Instagram responsive layout demo using SCSS

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build universally responsive navigation using files in the `app/` directory.


## Demo

Check out the [web demo here](https://expo-instagram-layout.netlify.app/). Pull the app and run in Expo Go to see the results on native.

### Responsive

A tab navigator that works well in landscape or portrait mode, same code used across web and native.

### No JavaScript, No Problem

On web, responsive CSS is used to ensure styles work even before the JavaScript has loaded.
